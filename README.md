##  What I Learned  
✅ The basic logic behind how the front-end and back-end components communicate  

✅ How to format html to work with python 

❌ Still don't intuitively understand how the code works, need more independent attempts 

##  Next Steps  
- Progressively add front-end components to my existing projects 
- Get a better grasp of JS and HTML, current understanding shaky
